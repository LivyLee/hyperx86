Plan is just to emulate the basic peripherals needed for a PC/XT to even post properly. Most 
devices will just be stubbed out.

## Getting Started

Hopefully just checking out the source code (when there is some) and running make in the src
directory will work.

<pre>
[11:17pm] rms@concord ~/hyperx86 % make -C src 
</pre>

## Running the Emulator

Hopefully, some documentation about that will go in here.

## Progress

Basically, nothing is complete. Or nothing even exists yet. That sort of is a blocking issue
and needs to be fixed as soon as possible.
